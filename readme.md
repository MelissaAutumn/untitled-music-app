# Untitled Music App

...working title

Just playing around with Pyside6, nothing to see here!

## Installation

Create a virtual env that allows access to system packages, install `requirements.txt`, and ensure you have kirigami and Pyside6 installed from your system package manager. (Yeah that's annoying I know.)
